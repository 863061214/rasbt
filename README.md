### Hi there, I am Bo Pei 👋

Research in **AI in Education**, **Educational Data Mining**, **Educational Data Visualization**, **HCI**

- ⚡️ I am currently an assistant professor in the Instructional Technology Program at College of Education at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/), Tampa, USA. I do interdisciplinary research in Computer Science and Education, seeking how to support an inclusive and effective teaching and learning experience with AI teachnologies.
- 🎓 I am passionate about solving educational problems with data-driven approaches and telling educational stories engaging and effective visualization strategies. I investigate analytical models/approaches to better model students' learning processes within large-scale, heterogenous learning data to promote personalized learning. I also closely examine the ethical issues such as data privacy and security, algorithmic transparency, trustworthiness and fariness while applying the cutting-edge techniques like AI in educational settings to support decision-making processes.
- 📖 The projects are shown below!
